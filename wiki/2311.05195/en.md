The paper introduces PRODIGy (PROfile-based DIalogue Generation), a novel dataset designed to enhance open-domain dialogue systems by integrating diverse and comprehensive speaker profile information. Derived from the Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus, PRODIGy contains over 20,000 dialogues aligned with multi-dimensional profiles including communication style, biography, personality (using MBTI types), and gender, providing both implicit and explicit persona representations.

The motivation stems from the limitations of existing persona-based dialogue datasets, which either use simplistic, dialogue-specific profiles or rely on implicit, hard-to-obtain user data. PRODIGy addresses these gaps by combining varied profile aspects in one resource, avoiding privacy issues since it is based on fictional movie characters, and allowing for future dataset expansion.

Experiments conducted with two baseline models—DialoGPT (fine-tuned) and GODEL (instruction-prompted)—demonstrate that incorporating diverse profile information improves dialogue generation in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios. Notably, models using biography sentences and personality traits show enhanced predictive performance and generalization compared to baselines.

Human evaluations reveal that, although generic responses are often favored when profile information is not disclosed, responses consistent with both dialogue and profile are clearly preferred when such information is made available to evaluators. The findings highlight the importance of profile data, especially in dialogues with limited context, and the dataset’s potential for advancing personalized, coherent, and contextually rich dialogue generation.

The paper also discusses limitations, such as potential role stereotyping due to fictional characters and binary gender classification, and emphasizes ethical considerations related to data privacy in profile-based systems. Overall, PRODIGy offers a rich, multi-faceted resource to support the development and benchmarking of more persona-aware conversational agents.
